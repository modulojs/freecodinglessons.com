# 4.1 - Activity 3 - Hello Modulo World!


This activity is incomplete, but will be released later. Follow the portion of
the other tutorial instead, at least until then:

<https://modulojs.org/tutorial/ramping-up/part1.html>



----------------------




Modulo is useful when using plain HTML and CSS is no longer sufficient. It has
no dependencies, does not require a "build process" to get started, and does
not require experience with JavaScript, terminal applications, or NPM. This
means it can be equally easily incorporated into a plain HTML "static site"
(e.g. when you assemble HTML, CSS, and other static assets in a directory), or
into a "multi-page" web app built with a backend language or MVC framework.

------------

Let's examine our first Modulo definition:

```
<Component name="HelloWorld">
    <Template>
        Hello <strong>Modulo</strong> World!
    </Template>
</Component>
```


Challenge 1: Including & Activating Modulo
