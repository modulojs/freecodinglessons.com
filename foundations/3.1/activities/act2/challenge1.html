<h2 class="font-medium text-3xl text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400">Biography</h2>
<p class="leading-6 text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">
    Alberto Santos-Dumont was born on 20th of July, 1873, the
    heir to a wealthy family in Palmira, in the state of Minas
    Gerais. He was one of the few people to have pioneered the
    early development of both lighter-than-air and
    heavier-than-air aircraft.

<h2>Deutsch Prize</h2>
<p>
    He designed, built, and flew the first powered airships and
    won the Deutsch Prize in 1901, when he flew around the
    Eiffel Tower in his airship No. 6, becoming one of the most
    famous people in the world in the early 20th century.

<h2>The First Airplane</h2>
<h3>14-bis</h3>
<p>
    Santos-Dumont then progressed to powered heavier-than-air
    machines and on 23 October 1906 flew about 60 metres at a
    height of two to three metres with the fixed-wing 14-bis
    (also dubbed the Oiseau de Proie—"bird of prey") at the
    Bagatelle Gamefield in Paris, taking off unassisted by an
    external launch system.

<h3>The French Aeroclub Prize</h3>
<p>
    On 12 November in front of a crowd, he flew 220 metres at a
    height of six metres. These were the first heavier-than-air
    flights certified by the Aeroclub of France, the first such
    flights officially witnessed by an aeronautics
    recordkeeping body, and the first of their kind recognised
    by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale.
