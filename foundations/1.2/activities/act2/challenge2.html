<h2>Exploring the origin of of the first computer games</h2>

<p>The Oregon Trail is a text-based strategy video game developed by Don
Rawitsch, Bill Heinemann, and Paul Dillenberger in 1971 and produced by the
Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (MECC) beginning in 1975.  The
original versions of the game contain no graphics, as they were developed for
computers that used teleprinters instead of computer monitors.</p>

<p>Zork is a text-based adventure game first released in 1977 by developers Tim
Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling for the PDP-10 mainframe
computer.</p>
