# Project 2 - Local Business

In this second project, we'll build a simple landing page for a business or
local store. Some people might use services like Squarespace or Wix to build a
quick landing page for their small business. This project can replace that with
a simple center-aligned design. In this design, we also learn how to embed a
Google Map, allowing potential customers to find us.
