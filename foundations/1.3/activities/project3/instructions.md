# Project 3 - Artist Page

In this third project, we'll embrace a bold, retro-inspired design style filled
with gradients and drop shadows in order to practice chaotic, artistic, and
art-focused design styles. The example project is building a "tribute" or
"stan" page for a real arist (June Chikuma), and shows her influential video
game soundtracks from the 80s and 90s that made her known in the genre, along
with a link to her modern work on experimental film and classical composition.

Some people might use services like Squarespace or Wix to build a quick landing
page for their artistic profile, but this shows how you can make a bold design
to stitch together your creations already, by embedding Soundcloud, Bandcamp,
and YouTube.


### Can you build the design by looking at the solution?
