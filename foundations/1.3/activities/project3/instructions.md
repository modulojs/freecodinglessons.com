# Project 3 - Local Business

In this third project, we'll build a simple landing page for a business or
local store. Some people might use services like Squarespace or Wix to build a
quick landing page for their small business. This project can replace that with
a simple center-aligned design. In this design, we also learn how to embed a
Google Map, allowing potential customers to find us.

--------------------------

## Can you build the design by looking at the solution?

- You will probably get stuck, so use the clues for snippets of code to read,
  understand as best you can, modify, and then include via copy and paste.

- Challenge mode: To truly put your skills to the test, carefully examine the
  solution in your browser, see how much of the solution you can recreate
  without checking the clues.

- Remember: It's always okay to copy & paste from previous activities!



--------------------------

## Clue 1

1. Open `clue1.html` in your text editor
2. Examine the code: This clue will provide most of the HTML for your landing
page, consisting of a mix of h1, h2, img, and p tags.
3. Copy and paste this code into a new HTML document, such as the empty file
called "project3.html" included here




--------------------------

## Clue 2

1. Open `clue2.html` in your text editor
2. Examine the code: This clue consists of a `<style>` tag that provides some
of the colors and layout of the project
3. Copy and paste this code into your project's HTML document, above any
existing code


--------------------------

## Clue 3

1. Open `clue3.html` in your text editor
2. Examine the code. This clue consists of another `<style>` tag that adjusts
image size, margin, padding, text size, and generally "cleans up" the design
compared to the previous version of CSS. It also adds a box-shadow based "glow"
effect around p-tags.
4. Copy and paste the individual properties you see (e.g. `margin: 0;`) into
the rules in your `<style>` tag


--------------------------

## Clue 4

1. Open `clue4.html` in your text editor
2. Examine the code. This time, we have our first "snippet"! It's an embedded
Google Map, allowing people to see where the location of the store is.
3. Note that the snippet consists of HTML tags that are beyond what we have
taught so far, so don't try to understand what is going on just yet. Instead,
think of it as just a "magic snippet" that will cause the form to appear!
4. *Optional:* If you are just trying to quickly complete this activity, feel
free to use the clue verbatim, and skip this step.
    - Note that this particular clue is for the address of the Hack & Learn
      Meet-Up associated with Free Coding Lessons, basically provided as an
      example.
    - If you want extra practice, you can learn how to get the snippet to embed
      Google Maps here: <https://support.google.com/maps/answer/144361>
5. Copy and paste the Google Map snippet (either from the clue or for a
map to a location that is important to you).
