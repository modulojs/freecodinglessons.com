# Project 4 - Artist Page

In this fourth project, we'll embrace a bold, retro-inspired design style
filled with gradients and drop shadows in order to practice chaotic, bright,
splashy, and art-focused design styles. The example project is building a
"tribute" or "stan" page for a real artist (June Chikuma). It showcases her
influential video game soundtracks from the 80s and 90s that made her known in
the genre, along with embedded audio and video with her modern work on
experimental film and classical composition.

Some people might use services like Squarespace or Wix to build a quick landing
page for their artistic profile, but this shows how you can make a bold design
to stitch together your creations already, by embedding Soundcloud, Bandcamp,
and YouTube.


--------------------------

## Can you build the design by looking at the solution?

- You will probably get stuck, so use the clues for snippets of code to read,
  understand as best you can, modify, and then include via copy and paste.

- Challenge mode: To truly put your skills to the test, carefully examine the
  solution in your browser, see how much of the solution you can recreate
  without checking the clues.

- Remember: It's always okay to copy & paste from previous activities!



--------------------------

## Clue 1

1. Open `clue1.html` in your text editor
2. Examine the code: This clue will provide most of the HTML for your landing
page, consisting of a mix of h1, img, and p tags.
3. Copy and paste this code into a new HTML document, such as the empty file
called "project4.html" included here




--------------------------

## Clue 2

1. Open `clue2.html` in your text editor
2. Examine the code. This time, we have several "snippets"! It's an embedded
Soundcloud player, YouTube video player, and finally BandCamp video player. All
of these showcase a song on June Chikuma's Soundcloud music profile, a fan-made
video of one of her 90s soundtracks on YouTube,
3. Note that the snippet consists of "iframe" tags, which are beyond what we have
taught so far, so don't try to understand every aspect of it. Instead,
think of each of these as "portals" into another webpage, created by another
company! (that is, Soundcloud, YouTube, Bandcamp, etc)
4. *Optional:* If you are just trying to quickly complete this activity, feel
free to use the clue verbatim, and skip this step.
    - Note that this particular clue is for June Chikuma.
    - You can get your own embedded snippets for all of these by looking for
      "SHARE" or "EMBED" buttons on their respective websites, and copying the
      "iframe" code for each different service.
5. Copy and paste the snippets (either from the clue or for something of your
own) into the correct locations in the HTML code.


--------------------------

## Clue 3

1. Open `clue3.html` in your text editor
2. Examine the code. This clue consists of a `<style>` tag that adjusts
image size, margin, padding, text size, and creates this new chaotic layout.
3. Copy and paste the individual properties you see (e.g. `margin: 0;`) into
the rules in your `<style>` tag


--------------------------

## Clue 4

1. Open `clue4.html` in your text editor
2. Examine the code. This clue consists of another `<style>` tag that
solidifies the design with gradients and drop shadows.
3. Copy and paste the individual properties into the rules in your `<style>` tag
