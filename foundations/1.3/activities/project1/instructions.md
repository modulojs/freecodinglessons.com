# Project 1 - "Link Tree" Landing Page

In this first project, we'll build a "link-tree" replacement. "Link tree" is a
popular website for making landing pages that collects all of your social media
or other web links into one spot that you can include in your profile to
promote your brand, store, or resume. This is one of the best beginner projects
to work on.

### Can you build the design by looking at the solution?
