# Project 1 - Video Game Store & Blog

In this first project for Lesson 2.3, we'll build a video game company landing page.


--------------------------

## Can you build the design by looking at the solution?

- You will probably get stuck, so use the clues for snippets of code to read,
  understand as best you can, modify, and then include via copy and paste.

- Challenge mode: To truly put your skills to the test, carefully examine the
  solution in your browser, see how much of the solution you can recreate
  without checking the clues (copying and pasting text, image URLs, etc, is
  okay).

- Remember: It's always okay to copy & paste from previous activities!



--------------------------

## Clue 1

1. Open `clue1.html` in your text editor
2. Examine the code: This clue will provide the "skeleton" of the page.
3. Copy and paste this code into a new HTML document, such as the empty file
called "project1.html" included here




--------------------------

## Clue 2

1. Open `clue2.css` in your text editor
2. Examine the code: This clue consists a CSS file that forms the beginning of
the pages style.
3. Add this in as a CSS file via a `link` tag


--------------------------

## Clue 3

1. Open `clue3.html` in your text editor
2. Examine the code: This clue has the content for another page.
3. Copy and paste this into a new HTML file and fix links to point there.



--------------------------

## Clue 4

1. Open `clue4.html` in your text editor
2. Examine the code. This clue once again contains code for another page.
3. Copy and paste this into the final page, fixing links to go there.
