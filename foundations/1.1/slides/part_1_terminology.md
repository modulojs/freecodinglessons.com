### General computer terminology

- **Computer:** An electronic device capable of running computer code, such as
  a desktop, laptop, smartphone, or tablet

- **Hardware:** The parts that go into the physical computer. For example,
  mouse, keyboard, monitor, storage, CPU, the motherboard, and the graphics
  card are all examples of "hardware".

- **Software:** The code and applications on a computer that, you know, do
  stuff. Everything that you "run" on a computer is "software", whether that is
  a web-based application, or something that you download.



---------------------------

### Hardware

Now that we've established some general terms, let's dive into important
hardware terminology. If you are very familiar with computer hardware, feel
free to skip this section.

- **Memory, aka RAM:**  Memory are the chip or chips on your computer that
  hold temporary data. The more memory your computer has the more things you
  can run at the same time. If you ever end up having too many tabs open and
  your computer slows down, it is "running out of memory". RAM requires
  continuous power: When you turn off your computer (or you run out of battery
  or lose power), everything you have in RAM goes away. That's why you lose
  documents that are unsaved.
    - Common values (as of 2023): 4GB - 32GB of RAM
    - For a physical analogy, you can think of it as your desk space in your
      office, e.g. how many documents and books can you have open at once.
    - RAM stands for "Random Access Memory" (random access being an older term
      for the alternative to "sequential access", e.g. a cassette tape).
    - Note that this is separate from the slower, long-term concept of
      "storage": Memory is only for *simultaneously running* software. Storage
      (covered next) is for saving stuff.

- **Storage, aka hard-drive, hard-disk, or SSD:** Storage is the hard-drive
  (older) or solid-state drive (modern) that stores data. Storage is slower to
  read and write from than memory, but is permanent. You run out of storage
    - Common values (as of 2023): 64GB - 1000GB+
    - For a physical analogy, you can think of it as your filing cabinets and
      shelves in your office, e.g. how many documents and books can you store
      in your office.

- **CPU:** The "Central Processing Unit", or the the "brain" of your computer.
  This is how fast your computer can run software. A slow CPU will make
  all software slower.

- **GPU:** The "Graphics Processing Unit", or the "visual brain" of your
  computer. Not all computers have GPUs. Computers that do have GPUs use them
  to make graphical processing faster. A slow or non-existant GPU will prevent
  you from using anything too graphically intensive, such as a 3D video game.

---------------------------

### Software terminology

- **Computer code:** The simplistic language that computers speak

- **Software Application**" - Computer code that other people wrote that you
  run on your computer

- **Bytes** - Units of measure for data on a computer. Everything stored on a
  computer is "data", and stored in binary (1s and 0s) code.

- **Filesystem** - The way that we organize all the data we store into
  different files, such as individual documents, images, and applications

---------------------------


### Bytes

- KB: 1 kilobyte = ~1000 bytes
- MB: 1 megabyte = ~1000 kilobytes
- GB: 1 gigabyte = ~1000 megabytes
- TB: 1 terabyte = ~1000 gigabytes

### Examples

To get an idea of how "big" different types of data is:

- `1MB - 8MB` - A single, high resolution JPG photo
- `10kb - 300kb` - Coding projects can be much less than 1 MB, unless they need
  photos
- `<1MB` - Text documents are usually less than 1 MB, unless they have photos
  or graphics embedded in them
- `50MB - 5GB` - Desktop applications, such as Firefox, VLC, or Word
- `1GB - 250GB` - Video games can take 1GB or less (indie games), or as much as
  250GB (big, blockbuster games) per game

### Filesystem terminology

Okay, now this one is important, since we'll be using this terminology the most
throughout the course.

### Bytes

- KB: 1 kilobyte = ~1000 bytes
- MB: 1 megabyte = ~1000 kilobytes
- GB: 1 gigabyte = ~1000 megabytes
- TB: 1 terabyte = ~1000 gigabytes

### Examples

To get an idea of how "big" different types of data is:

- `1MB - 8MB` - A single, high resolution JPG photo
- `10kb - 300kb` - Coding projects can be much less than 1 MB, unless they need
  photos
- `<1MB` - Text documents are usually less than 1 MB, unless they have photos
  or graphics embedded in them
- `50MB - 5GB` - Desktop applications, such as Firefox, VLC, or Word
- `1GB - 250GB` - Video games can take 1GB or less (indie games), or as much as
  250GB (big, blockbuster games) per game
