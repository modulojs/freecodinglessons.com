1.1 - Activity 1 - Hello Coding World!
----------------------------------

Programming involves writing "code". Coding is writing a special "language"
that computers can understand. Throughout the Fundamentals of Web Design
course, you will be learning three programming languages: HTML, CSS, and a even
a little bit of JavaScript. The first language you will learn is the basis of
all of the web: HTML.


- HTML is the programming language used to compose HTML documents
- HTML documents are a technical term for what makes up web pages. Every web
  page is a downloaded HTML document that is displayed in your browser.
- If you learn the correct symbols and commands to use, then you can compose
  HTML documents, and make turn your website dreams into a reality!

Challenge 1: Hello World
----------------------------------

The traditional first thing you learn in any programming language is "Hello
World". Let's start there!

* Objective: Write an HTML page that says "Hello Coding World"

1. Open `challenge1.html` in your text editor and browser.
2. Examine the existing code. It says simply "Hello World".
3. Observe how in the browser it also says "Hello World".
4. The goal for Challenge 1 is to change the "code", and then refresh, to make
the browser say "Hello Coding World".

Hint 1: Stuck? The goal of this challenge is to get familiar with the editor,
so don't over think this. In HTML, this task is as simple as typing "Hello
Coding World" into the code editor.

Hint 2: If you are still stuck while using the web editor, click between the
words "Hello" and "World", and then type "Coding".  Then, click the "Refresh"
button that looks like rotating arrows on the right.

Challenge 2: The H1 opening tag
----------------------------------

That Hello World text in the browser is too small. Let's turn it into a Header.

* Objective: Write the code for the H1 tag.

1. Open `challenge2.html` in your text editor and browser.
2. Examine the existing code. It says "Hello Coding World", similar to before.
3. Type `<h1>` before the code.
    - `<` (less than, or often pronounced "opening pointy bracket")
    - `h1` (the letter `h` followed by the number `1`)
    - `>` (greater than, or often pronounced "closing pointy bracket")
4. Refresh the browser. If done correctly, this creates a *Header 1 tag*,
causing the text Hello Coding World to get large.

- Hint: Stuck? In the end, your challenge should look like:

```
<h1>Hello Coding World
```




-------------



Challenge 3: The H1 closing tag
----------------------------------

We don't want to shout all the time. Let's close the Header, so text becomes
normal sized again.

* Objective: Learn to write the code for closing H1 tags

1. Open `challenge3.html` in your text editor and browser.
2. Examine the existing code. This time, the text is too big: We only want
"Hello Coding World" to be the title
3. Type `</h1>` after the first line (the one that says "Hello Coding World").
    - This "closing" tag is similar to the "opening" tag, except for one
      difference: It has a "slash", starting with `</` instead of `<`.
4. Refresh the browser. If done correctly, this should cause the text that
starts with "I am taking my first, brave steps..." to get smaller.

- Hint: Stuck? In the end, your challenge should look like:

```
<h1>Hello Coding World</h1>

I am taking my first, brave steps into the world of coding.
I will be making websites very soon! I can't wait!
```

Challenge 4: My First Web Page
----------------------------------

Practice makes perfect. Let's expand this into our first (little!) webpage.

* Objective: Learn to add a greater quantity of tags and text.

1. Open [challenge4.html](./challenge4.html) in your text editor and browser.
2. Examine the existing code. Already there's an H1 tag and a few sentences of
text.
3. Now, we'll practice more text. To complete this challenge, add 2 more
h1-tags, and two more short paragraphs of content.  You can think of it as
forming two more "sections" to your website, such as areas to discuss two more
topics. You should make it in the same format as the top section. You can copy
and paste text from below, so you don't have to type up a lot of text:

```

```

* Hint #1: Stuck? The first section will look like:

```
<h1>About me</h1>
I'm a new coder who is taking the Fundamentals of Web Design course.
```

* Hint #2: Stuck? The second section will look like:

```
<h1>Contact Me</h1>
Have a web project, and you need some help? Contact me for a quote.
