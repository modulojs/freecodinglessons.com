<h1>FROGS</h1>

<h2>Classification</h2>
<p>Frogs are amphibians and vertebrates of the order Anura.</p>

<h2>Frogs vs Toads</h2>
<p>There is not much difference between frogs and toads, and they are not
classified separately.  This is because the toad lifestyle, with its dry,
rough, skin, is an adaptation to living in drier habitats. The toad form has
evolved a number of times independently, an example of convergent
evolution.</p>
