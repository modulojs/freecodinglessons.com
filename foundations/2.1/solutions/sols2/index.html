<p>Let's explore the biographies of a few brilliant mathematicians in
computer history.</p>

<p>In the early 1800s, <a href="babbage.html">Charles Babbage</a> and <a
href="lovelace.html">Ada Lovelace</a> were friends and co-created many early
(theoretical) computer programs. Ada envisioned an idea of programming that
pushed further, and theorized that computer programming could eventually
automate factories, or play music. She was right. <a href="turing.html">Alan
Turing</a>'s brilliant mathematical model of a computer would prove the full
extent of this branch of mathematics possible, about 100 years later in
1936.</p>
