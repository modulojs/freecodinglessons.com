<p>Charles Babbage was an English polymath. A mathematician, philosopher,
inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital
programmable computer.</p>

<p>Babbage is considered by some to be "father of the computer".  Babbage is
credited with inventing the first mechanical computer, the Difference Engine,
that eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the
essential ideas of modern computers are to be found in Babbage's Analytical
Engine, programmed using a principle openly borrowed from the Jacquard loom.
Babbage had a broad range of interests in addition to his work on computers
covered in his book Economy of Manufactures and Machinery.  His varied work in
other fields has led him to be described as "pre-eminent" among the many
polymaths of his century.</p>

<p>The Analytical Society was a group of individuals in early-19th-century
Britain whose aim was to promote the use of Leibnizian notation for
differentiation in calculus as opposed to the Newton notation for
differentiation. The latter system came into being in the 18th century as a
convention of Sir Isaac Newton, and was in use throughout Great Britain.
According to a mathematical historian: In 1800, English mathematics was trapped
in the doldrums of fluxional notation and of an intuitive geometric-physical
approach to mathematics designed to prepare the student for reading Newton's
Principia...The study of any mathematics not pertinent to the traditional
questions of Tripos was not only ignored, but actually discouraged. Cambridge
was isolated, and its students remained ignorant of continental
developments.</p>
