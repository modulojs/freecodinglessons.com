<p>Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician,
cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly
influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a
formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing
machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. He is
widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and
artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Although Turing's proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church's
equivalent proof using his lambda calculus, Turing's approach is considerably
more accessible and intuitive than Church's. It also included a notion of a
'Universal Machine' (now known as a universal Turing machine), with the idea
that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine
(as indeed could Church's lambda calculus). According to the Churchâ€“Turing
thesis, Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing
anything that is computable. John von Neumann acknowledged that the central
concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper. To this day, Turing
machines are a central object of study in theory of computation.</p>

<p>From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying
under Church at Princeton University, in the second year as a Jane Eliza
Procter Visiting Fellow. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he
studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical
binary multiplier. In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from the Department of
Mathematics at Princeton; his dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals,
introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing,
in which Turing machines are augmented with so-called oracles, allowing the
study of problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines. John von Neumann
wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant, but he went back to the
United Kingdom.</p>

<p>During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and
Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that
produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section that was
responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a number of
techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements
to the pre-war Polish bomba method, an electromechanical machine that could
find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking
intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in
many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic.  Turing was
prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts. He accepted hormone treatment with DES,
a procedure commonly referred to as chemical castration, as an alternative to
prison. Turing died on 7 June 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from
cyanide poisoning. (From Wikipedia)</p>
