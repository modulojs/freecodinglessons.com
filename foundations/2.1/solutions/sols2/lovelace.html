<p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27
November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her
work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the
Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had
applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm
intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often
regarded as the first computer programmer. (From Wikipedia)</p>

<p>She speculated that the Engine "might act upon other things besides number…
the Engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree
of complexity or extent." The idea of a machine that could manipulate symbols
in accordance with rules and that number could represent entities other than
quantity mark the fundamental transition from calculation to computation. Ada
was the first to explicitly articulate this notion and in this she appears to
have seen further than Babbage. She has been referred to as "prophet of the
computer age." Certainly she was the first to express the potential for
computers outside mathematics. (From "Ada Lovelace" at Computer History
Museum)</p>

<p>From 1832, when she was seventeen, her mathematical abilities began to
emerge, and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult
life. Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she
accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an
early age. She was privately educated in mathematics and science by William
Frend, William King, and Mary Somerville, the noted 19th-century researcher and
scientific author. In the 1840s, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan extended
her "much help in her mathematical studies" including study of advanced
calculus topics including the "numbers of Bernoulli" (that formed her
celebrated algorithm for Babbage's Analytical Engine). In a letter to Lady
Byron, De Morgan suggested that Ada's skill in mathematics might lead her to
become "an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence".
