<p>Let's explore the biographies of a few brilliant mathematicians in
computer history.</p>

<p>Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace were close friends and co-created many
early (theoretical) computer programs. Ada envisioned an idea of programming
that pushed further, and theorized that computer programming could eventually
automate factories, or play music. She was right. Alan Turing's brilliant
mathematical of a computer would prove the full extent of this branch of
mathematics possible, about 100 years later.</p>
