<h1>Ada Lovelace</h1>

<p>Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace was an English mathematician and
writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical
general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise
that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have
published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.</p>
