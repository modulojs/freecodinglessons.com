    <x-markdown src="./overview.md" modulo-original-html=""><h1>Overview</h1>Welcome to the Foundations of Web Design course.<br>This course is divided into 4 parts, of 3 lessons each. Each lesson has 4
activities or projects to build. The third lesson of each part is called a
<em>Project Lab</em>, because it is focused on combining the skills of the previous
two lessons into several larger and more practical projects.<br><strong>Work In Progress:</strong> This course is in "early access". Presently, Part 1 is
mostly complete, while Parts 2 through 4 are still in heavy development and are
in varying levels of completion.<h2>Course Sections</h2><h3>Part 1 - Single Page Sites</h3>Learn single page and single columns designs. Learn the most
basic core of HTML and CSS, letting you create simple one column
layouts for things like landing pages, profile pages or "link
trees", or business pages.<br><strong>PROJECT LAB:</strong> After just 3 lessons that can be completed by beginners in
under 2 hours each, you will have the skills to build each of the following
designs, even learning how to integrate plug-ins that permit e-commerce, audio,
video, and more:<br><ul><li><a href="https://modulojs.github.io/foundations/1.3/solutions/project_1.html">Personal Landing Page (like "Link Tree")</a></li><li><a href="https://modulojs.github.io/foundations/1.3/solutions/project_2.html">Small Business Page</a></li><li><a href="https://modulojs.github.io/foundations/1.3/solutions/project_2.html">Artist or Creative Page</a></li></ul><h3>Part 2 - Multi Page Sites</h3>Learn how to link together multiple HTML and CSS files. You'll also get a
chance to learn more HTML and CSS concepts, such as tag nesting, classes, and
flex-based column layouts, and be able to build more sophisticated designs with
multiple pages to navigate to.<br><strong>PROJECT LAB:</strong> After only more 3 lessons that can be completed by beginners
in under 2 hours each, you will have the skills to build more complicated
websites, complete with menus, navigations, subpages, article pages,
integrations with Shopify, and more:<br><ul><li><a href="#">Corporate Page</a></li><li><a href="#">Tech Blog</a></li><li><a href="#">Online Store</a></li></ul><h3>Part 3 - Forms and Layouts with Tailwind</h3>Learn how to use popular frontend frameworks like Tailwind and popular hosting
platforms like Netlify to rapidly create and deploy sites. You'll also get
practice creating and designing useful, practical forms, allowing for people to
submit information or go through sign-up processes. You'll get practice
integrating with other popular APIs as well, such as Google Fonts and AirTable.<br><strong>PROJECT LAB:</strong> After just 3 lessons that can be completed by beginners in
under 2 hours each, you will have the skills to build rich designs using
pre-made design elements, forms that submit their contents, and complex
websites that accept more complex user input:<br><ul><li><a href="#">Video Game Launch Site</a></li><li><a href="#">Scientific Survey Website</a></li><li><a href="#">Non-Profit / NGO Page</a></li></ul><h3>Part 4 - Web Components with Modulo</h3>Learn how to build re-usable web components and refactor your code to save time
and rapidly develop more complex sites. You'll learn how to use Modulo.js to
build layouts and individual components with re-usable bits of HTML and CSS.
This last portion of the course will bring your understanding of frontend more
up-to-date with the modern style of making websites, using the so-called
JAM-Stack.<br><strong>PROJECT LAB:</strong> After just 3 lessons that can be completed by beginners in
under 2 hours each, you will have the skills to build web apps that have
JavaScript-powered interactivity, with examples in data analytics, web
publishing, and even how to create a web-based keyboard or synthesizer. The
projects are somewhat more advanced than previous ones, and show the huge
variety of new things you can build with your new skills:<br><ul><li><a href="#">Modulo Data Dashboard</a></li><li><a href="#">Multi-User CMS</a></li><li><a href="#">Tone.js-Powered Synthesizer and Step Sequencer</a></li></ul><h2>Activities</h2><h3>Part 1</h3><h4>1.1</h4><ul><li>Activity 1 - Intro to HTML H1-tag</li><li>Activity 2 - More HTML tags, p-tag, h1-H4-tag</li><li>Activity 3 - Your first CSS (style tag, color, p selector, h1 selector)</li><li>Activity 4 - Body and background (Using "body" selector, setting background</li></ul>

  GitHub Pages (how to get it to prebuild)<h1>Design Labs</h1>Note: These are most likely to change. Also, may be ordered as 1.2 instead.<h2>1.4 - Design Lab 1</h2><ul><li>Activity 1 - PenPot Basics</li></ul><pre class="code poetry"><code>- How to sign-up and/or download PenPot (or Figma)
- How to draw some simple shapes
- Don't worry about drawing designs, for Design Lab 1 it's just doodling
- Students produce a simple little doodle (e.g. a landscape, with a blue
  square for sky and a green square for the horizon, a yellow circle for
  the sun, some green circles for hills or something, a free-form drawn
  river, something like that.)</code></pre><ul><li>Activity 2 - PenPot Colors, Palettes, and Color Theory</li></ul><pre class="code poetry"><code>- How to select different colors in PenPot
- The idea of mixing "primary colors" to make others (RGB and RGBA, maybe
  also briefly the subtractive primaries CMY / CMYK)
- The idea of "alpha" (transparency)
- Show how these generate hex codes
- *Starting the style guide:* As an on-going activity, students will be
  "building up" a style guide.
- Students assemble a few color palettes, one that should be light on dark,
  and another that's and dark on light (this consists of a drawing that's
  basically squares with named colors, e.g.  Canary Yellow)</code></pre><ul><li>Activity 3 - PenPot export, file format exploration</li></ul><pre class="code poetry"><code>- How to export as PNG or SVG
- How to export as HTML / CSS
- Talk about difference between popular image file formats (PNG, JPG, SVG),
  and how to turn on extensions on different file systems
- Students practice saving their style guide as each format, and examining
  how it looks in different image viewers.
- PNG: Show how PNG can have transparency and is lossless, no artifacts,
  but is often bigger. It's a good choice for anything except large photos.
- JPG: Show how JPG can't have transparency, and also is "lossy" and thus
  can have "artifacts" (mistakes during encoding), but is the most size
  efficient for large photographs.
- SVG: Show how SVG is crisp even when zoomed in, but is a "vector" format
  meaning it can only be exported from vector editors like PenPot since
  "remembers" the shapes and drawing (unlike "raster" formats JPG/PNG), and
  is actually rendered on the device, meaning more complicated SVGs risk
  being inconsistent accross devices, or in even slow to display.</code></pre><ul><li>Activity 4 - Single-file Netlify Launch</li></ul><pre class="code poetry"><code>- How to sign-up for Netlify and upload single files

- Show other alignments
- Student produces a wireframe / then mockup of a multi-column layout</code></pre><ul><li>Activity 3 - Project file management</li></ul><pre class="code poetry"><code>- Since projects are getting more complicated, start practicing file management and paths
- Show good practices of having a "work" or "projects" etc directory</code></pre><ul><li>Activity 4 - Multi-File Netlify Launch</li></ul><pre class="code poetry"><code>- Create fool-proof guides for launching entire directories with Netlify.
- If the drag n drop approach of Design Lab 1 is too hard, maybe using Git
