<h1>Computer History: Mathematics</h1>

<p>Let's explore the biographies of a few brilliant mathematicians in
computer history.</p>

<p><a href="babbage.html">Charles Babbage</a> and <a>Ada Lovelace</a> were
close friends and co-created many early (theoretical) computer programs. Ada
envisioned an idea of programming that pushed further, and theorized that
computer programming could eventually automate factories, or play music. She
was right. <a>Alan Turing</a>'s brilliant mathematical of a computer would
prove the full extent of this branch of mathematics possible, about 100 years
later.</p>
