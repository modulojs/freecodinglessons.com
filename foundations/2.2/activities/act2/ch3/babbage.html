<h1>Charles Babbage</h1>





<p>Charles Babbage was an English polymath. A mathematician, philosopher,
inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital
programmable computer.</p>

<p>Babbage is considered by some to be "father of the computer".  Babbage is
credited with inventing the first mechanical computer, the Difference Engine,
that eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the
essential ideas of modern computers are to be found in Babbage's Analytical
Engine, programmed using a principle openly borrowed from the Jacquard loom.
Babbage had a broad range of interests in addition to his work on computers
covered in his book Economy of Manufactures and Machinery.  His varied work in
other fields has led him to be described as "pre-eminent" among the many
polymaths of his century.</p>

<p>Babbage co-founded  the Analytical Society. The Analytical Society was a
group of individuals in early-19th-century Britain whose aim was to promote the
use of Leibnizian notation for differentiation in calculus as opposed to the
Newton notation for differentiation. The latter system came into being in the
18th century as a convention of Sir Isaac Newton, and was in use throughout
Great Britain.  According to a mathematical historian: In 1800, English
mathematics was trapped in the doldrums of fluxional notation and of an
intuitive geometric-physical approach to mathematics designed to prepare the
student for reading Newton's Principia...The study of any mathematics not
pertinent to the traditional questions of Tripos was not only ignored, but
actually discouraged. Cambridge was isolated, and its students remained
ignorant of continental developments. (From Wikipedia)</p>
