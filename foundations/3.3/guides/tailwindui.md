# Tailwind UI Samples


## Intro to the Guide

> This is a guide for students at
> [FreeCodingLessons.com](https://freecodinglessons.com/), and it's Foundations
> of Web Design, a free web design course intended to allow everyone to design
> cool sites.


Tailwind UI has both a free sample, but mostly is a premium design subscription
service. Since this course is about keeping things free (or at least cheap),
this guide only emphasizes the components they give out for free on their site.

The goal of this guide is for students to have easy access to collection of
only a few of the components, carefully chosen to make it easier to learn, and
quickly assemble pages and a novice designer.
