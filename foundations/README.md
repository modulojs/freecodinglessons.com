Thanks for considering my course! Let me introduce why I created it.

For over seven years I have lead instruction and developed curriculum for
"coding bootcamp" training programs in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Throughout
this time the instructors and students I worked with were frustrated at the
lack of high-quality, open access, no-nonsense coding curriculum. Instead,
search engines turn up endless pages of content hidden behind paywalls,
cluttered with messy ads and flashy animations, and out-dated instructions that
slow down beginners trying to build websites or break into the tech industry.
The very worst part is that this "clutter" problem is the most acute at the
foundational stages of learning. This can make learning to code feel like
navigating a noisy, chaotic, carnival-like maze!

I designed *Foundations of Web Design* to bridge this gap. I want it to be a
fun, accessible, and immediately useful web design course. Most importantly, I
am releasing it free forever under a free/libre open source license.  I hope
that both absolute beginners and intermediate learners will be empowered by
taking this course to build cool, expressive, modern, and useful websites.  I
can't wait to see what you all will build based on this!

        See you in class!
