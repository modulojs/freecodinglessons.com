        <h4>Early Access</h4>
        <p>This course isn't finished yet! This is a course that is under public
        development. Think of it as an "early access" or "beta test". For now,
        only the first part is publicly available, however 3 more are in
        development.</p>

    <h2>How to begin</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Install a (free) code editor or IDE, such as
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> or
            <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/modulojs/foundations/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">Download
        and extract the Foundations of Web Design Zip file</a>
        </li><li>Open <tt>1.1/activities/act1/challenge1.html</tt> in your text
        editor or file browser, and then begin the first lesson: <a href="/foundations/1.1/">1.1 - HTML Basics</a></li>
    </ol>
    <div style="margin-top: 150px">
        <h2>How to learn</h2>
        <p>Congratulations on starting your coding journey with us!</p>

        <p>This document (and, soon, videos) will explain how to use the
        learning platform that you are using right now, and our rapid learning
        methodology.  You'll probably have some questions lingering after all
        this, so don't hesitate to ask if you run into any issues with our
        software, or have any questions about our learning methodology.</p>

        <h2>Lessons</h2>
        <p>You should set a timer to complete each lesson in 2 hours. If you
        find yourself stuck on a particular lesson for longer than 2 hours,
        then move-on, and revisit the concept later.</p>

        <h2>Zip file</h2>
        <p>The zip file contains activities directories, demos directories, and
        solution directories. Resist the urge to go into the solutions
        directory when you first get stuck -- you have to power through this,
        no peeking!</p>
        <p>The activities directory consists of a series of project-based
        challenges that get increasingly difficult.  Most activities have an
        instructions.md file, which is a Markdown file with instructions on how
        to complete it.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Each activity is divided into a series of challenges. The challenges
        get increasingly difficult. Focus only on completing the first few
        challenges on your "first try" -- you will not have time for all of
        them.</p>
        <p>For beginners, there can be more to learn and understand than what
        can be done in 30 minutes, and so your "first pass" should be about
        breadth not depth. This is to prevent this issue common with beginners,
        where you "miss the forest for the trees", and avoid getting hung up on
        smaller details that will become clearer as you progress. Set a 20-30
        minute timer for each activity. Resist the urge to keep on attempting
        challenges, instead try moving on to the next one. Only after your first
        "2 hour" session for the lesson, then you can go back and repeat the
        harder challenges. The first challenges are designed to warm up, and
        then give some practice on the "gist" of what you are learning, without
        getting bogged down with details or advanced features</p>



        <h3>Types of content</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Lessons - These are sets coding activities, slides, and
            occasional videos that can be accomplished in 2 hour intervals.
            They are intended to simulate being in a real workshop-style
            classroom. The activities you do in them help prepare you for the
            Project Labs.</li>
            <li>Project Labs - The goal of a Project Lab is to apply your
            knowledge to bigger designs. These are lessons that don't introduce
            much new material, as much as give repeated practice with concepts
            learned in the previous lessons, along with practical new ways to
            apply the concepts.</li>
            <li>Design Labs - The goal of a Design Lab is to learn skills
            beyond coding: Computer design skills, along with computer power
            user skills necessary for this skillset.</li>
        </ol>
