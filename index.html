            <h3>Why should I learn to code?</h3>
            <p>I get asked this a lot. The typical answer is that designing
            websites can be a fun and rewarding experience, not to mention a
            useful career skill.
            But I think a lot of people want to know what they can
            <em>build</em>. Read on to learn about the potential for new
            skills, and browse the designs you'll be building along the

            <h3>Who made <em>Foundations of Web Design</em>, and why did you make it free?</h3>
            <p><em>Foundations of Web Design</em> was originally
            developed by <a href="https://michaelb.org">Michael
            B.</a>, an instructor at <a href="http://kickstartcoding.com/">Kickstart Coding</a>,
            and creator of the <a href="https://modulojs.org/">Modulo.js mini-framework</a>.
            The curriculum is free forever because it's under a free license.
            Read on for the rationale!</p>

        </aside>

        <div style="background: WhiteSmoke; padding: 20px; font-family: serif; text-align: justify">
        <p>Thanks for considering my course! Let me introduce why I created it.</p>

        <p>For over seven years I have lead instruction and developed curriculum for
        "coding bootcamp" training programs in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Throughout
        this time the instructors and students I worked with were frustrated at the
        lack of high-quality, open access, no-nonsense coding curriculum. Instead,
        search engine results turns up endless pages of content hidden behind paywalls,
        cluttered with messy ads and flashy animations, and out-dated instructions that
        slow down beginners trying to build websites or break into the tech industry.
        The very worst part is that this "clutter" problem is the most acute at the
        foundational stages of learning, making learning to code sometimes feel like
        navigating a noisy, chaotic, carnival-like maze!</p>

        <p>I designed <em>Foundations of Web Design</em> to fill in this gap. I want it
        to be a fun, useful, and immediately useful web design course. Most
        importantly, I am releasing it free forever under a free/libre open source
        license. A dependable learning resource that's accessible to self-teach, while
        teaching powerful skills that provide results in both work and personal
        projects.  I hope that both absolute beginners, and even intermediate learners
        looking to fill in gaps, will be empowered by taking this course to build cool,
        creative, expressive, modern, and useful websites and web applications. I can't
        wait to see what you will all build based on this!</p>

        <pre>See you in class!
        - Michael</pre>
